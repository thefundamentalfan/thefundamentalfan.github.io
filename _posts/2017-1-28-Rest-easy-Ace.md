When tragedy strikes, the silver lining can be in the reaction of the community. I like to think that if people come
together and try to make each other feel better after something bad happens, that bad thing won't be all of 
what we remember. I like to think that it allows us to remember the good things, too.

Earlier this week, the Royals community lost a member of its family. Yordano Ventura, the free-wheeling,
velocity-chasing young pitcher that made up some of the hope that we all had in our young pitching staff throughout
the Royals' recent playoff runs, passed away. But rather than dwell on the bad, I'm thinking of the good tonight. 
I'm thinking of all the good that made up the young man we all affectionately refer to as "Ace."

There was a lot of good in him. I tweeted a short form of this sentiment when I first heard the news, 
but now that I've had some time to really think about Ventura, I realized how great of a young man he was.
His passion came through any medium, whether you were watching him from a few hundred feet away at Kauffman
or from miles away on your screen, and that makes up a lot of the respect I have for Ventura as a player.
You could tell he was putting his all into every pitch, with his slightly erratic delivery style and his 
hard-hitting fastballs, seemingly always near that 100-mph mark. He smiled, laughed, or cheered at every out,
and cheered even harder when his teammates were getting base hits or knocking homers. He defended his teammates
even if it meant getting suspended. He got angry at umpires and disagreed with coaches, he argued with opposing players,
and he got into fights. Baseball was his life, and he played baseball well.

He cared.

He cared about what he was doing, and he cared about the beautiful sport of baseball. It wasn't just numbers and
wins to him - it was about the very human desire to do the thing you love, and do it well, and leave it all on the field.

Maybe a better writer could write a better tribute to Yordano. I think my strengths lie in my clarity.

I like that he cared.
