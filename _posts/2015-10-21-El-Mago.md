On paper, baseball is fairly rudimentary; nine players on both
teams switching back and forth between offense and defense, taking their turn at 
the plate and then out in the field. Then what about it keeps fans like myself coming 
back time and time again? For me it’s the chance to witness something that is outside 
my realm of explanation, and that is what is happening for Alcides Escobar. This 
season Escobar had a .293 OBP, pitiful for any would-be lead off man, and yet Ned 
Yost has time and time again decided to put his faith in Esky, and with good reason. 
Since last season the Royals are 47 games over .500 when Escobar leads off 
according to the Kansas City Star. After yesterday's 14-2 rout of the Blue Jays, “El 
Mago” has solidified himself as the far and away MVP of the series for our boys in 
blue. During this series versus Toronto, Esky is batting .600, has 6 runs and on top of 
that 5 RBI’s. Even to the casual viewer of baseball, Escobar’s ability to turn it on 
when it counts is something to witness.

In an interview with FS1, Esky said, “I’m aggressive all the time, any pitch in the strike zone I would like to swing.” This 
aggression has really shown through with his pitch count. Tuesday night, in 6 plate 
appearances, Escobar saw a grand total of 16 pitches [Editor's note: that's a really low number, folks.] But Escobar doesn’t do all of 
his damage behind the plate, he also does it out in the field. With dreams of one day 
winning a gold glove, Escobar commands the SS position with incredible grace. My 
personal favorite thing about him is how he just plays and takes no prisoners while 
he’s doing it.

“I like to play relaxed,” Escobar says, and it sure has shown this 
postseason.  The rest of the Royals embraced the “play relaxed” approach Tuesday 
night, setting a record for most sac flies in a postseason game with four. I think this records 
symbolizes the Royals successful attempt to revive the forgotten art of small ball. 
With aggressive AB’s, contact, and speed, “El Mago” has been able to will his team to 
the threshold of another World Series birth, although the statistics may say that 
what we all are seeing shouldn’t be happening. I can say definitively, however, that it sure is 
fun to watch.
