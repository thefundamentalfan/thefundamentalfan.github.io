title: On Jayhawk Basketball: Predictions
---
By Spencer Norkey

How good will the Jayhawks be this year? Will they be another 2008 team? Or will they be a team like last year's, decent enough to have a winning record, but by my standards of Jayhawks basketball, a pretty bad team overall? What will the team look like this season?

The Jayhawks definitely have a chance at capitalizing on their roster strength, with players such as Ellis, Selden, and the recruited Diallo, who still is yet to be declared eligible. They also have potential players, such as Sviatoslav, one of their big guys that has yet to see much play time. Losing Oubre and Alexander was a big hit, but the strength of the roster is still high enough for the season to have championship potential.

To be a championship team, though, many of the players need to step up their games. Brannen Greene, a three point shooter who missed almost every shot he took at the end of last year, must be able to start producing again. As long as he and Selden can start to produce on the perimeter, the team will have a great edge over other opponents.

Defense, too, will need to be worked on. Ellis has played fantastic defense in his years, but most of the other players, especially the center on the court at the time, must start producing on the other end of the court. Diallo has shown promise, using his speed to get in front of opponents and block shots, but he must be able to do this in real play. The forwards must step up too, especially Greene. His offensive game is lacking right now, but his defensive game has never been there. He must work on this and improve it before he sees play time.

So what will happen this season? It really hinges on whether Diallo is cleared to play, if Greene can step up his game, if our defensive game improves, and if our homefield advantage can stay as good as it has been. If they can come together and improve everywhere, I can see a deep run into the tournament, and the season going quite well, losing to perhaps only Iowa State, Kentucky, and Oklahoma State. But if they don't pull everything together and play like they did last year, it will end in the same, unsatisfactory, manner as it did.
