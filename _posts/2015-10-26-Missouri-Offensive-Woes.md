title: Missouri Tigers' Offensive Woes
---
By Daric Bokarae

Every Saturday I feel as if I’m forced to watch the newest installment of the 
show “Missouri Tigers can’t move the football,” and to be 100% honest, I’m very 
tired of it.

This week the Tigers dropped their third game straight against the 
Vanderbilt Commodores by the score of 10-3. Missouri had 188 total yards of 
offense and went 0-14 on third downs. In the last three games the tigers have 
converted 3 of 41 third downs. 

Drew Lock had another rough week throwing the football going 14 for 34 
with 108 yards passing, but how much blame can you really put on the true 
freshman quarterback? The offensive line is in shambles; even with the switch of Nate 
Crawford from right tackle to left guard and keeping Chappell at right tackle, once 
heralded by Pinkel as the fix to the offensive ineptitudes, only netted the offense 
an increase of 24 yards from last week. Keep in mind that this includes when Corey Fatony, the punter, 
ran for a 26 yard trick play. The wide receiving core seems as inexperienced as ever:
they consistently drop passes and seem to be excellent at not getting open, but, even 
if one of them were to get open, Lock most likely wouldn’t have even noticed. Russell 
Hansbrough, Missouri’s best position player, can’t run the ball behind this 
offensive line, which only puts more pressure on the arm of Lock, but Lock definitely 
had flaws: he was completely unable to look off defenders or survey the field, often 
staring down one wide receiver until he threw the football. Hopefully problems like 
these will be fixed with more time in the system, and more games under his belt.

But the question in every Tigers fans mind is this: Why was this team so ill 
prepared to play after two straight SEC East Championships? Strength as a team is a constant ebb and flow, but that doesn’t explain why this team is forced to rely on so 
many freshman and redshirt freshman players to have success, Mizzou has never 
pretended to be a white collar program like your Ohio States of college football, but 
they have consistently been able to land middle to high star recruits, like Dorial 
Green-Beckham and Terry Beckner Jr., which makes the lack of offensive talent 
mind boggling.

With all meaningful goals for the season out the window, and their chances of 
winning the SEC East officially nonexistent, the Tigers must find a way to scrap 
together two more wins for a bowl game appearance, but with the schedule that 
remains, even bowl eligibility looks like it may be in doubt. 

Heading into a bye week, Gary Pinkel will attempt to right the ship, but at this point it won’t really do them any good.
