title: Time Changes a Team

By Zac Cole

In 2005, just 10 years ago, the Royals finished the season with an abysmal record of 56-106. No typo, no mistake. The Kansas City Royals really lost 106 games in 2005.

They finished last in the AL Central. They were 43 games back from the first place Chicago White Sox. To put that into perspective, 43 wins is over a quarter of an entire MLB season. They were also 11 games back of the next worst record in the 2005 season. And 39 games back from even just a wild card berth. They went through 3 managers that season. Basically, they were bad. You know those teams that are so bad that you’re actually embarrassed if you lose to them? The Royals were that team. In other words, baseball in Kansas City was not a happy thing. 

Jump forward 10 years. The Royals are the defending 2014 American League Champions. They finished the 2015 season with a record of 95-67 (Yes, just 11 more losses in 2015 than wins in 2005). They are the AL Central Champions. And if that’s not good enough for you, the Royals had 7 all-stars in the 2015 All-Star Game. And if, somehow, you’re still not convinced, three of their players also have Gold Glove awards. Basically, they are good.

It’s amazing what just 10 years can do. The Kansas City Royals are a legitimately good team now. They are exciting. They are fun. They are intriguing. You never know what you’ll see while watching a Royals game. Anything from their early inning runs to their late 8th inning comebacks to their crazy plays to their hot bats, it is insanely fun to watch them. The fans love this team (a new attendance record was broken this season!). These Royals have made all of Kansas City fall in love with baseball again. It’s amazing. I hope this team is here to stay.

Now ... let’s take this crown.
