Let's start with a riddle on this lovely afternoon before a Royals game.

What do Goldilocks, the strong American middle class, and the Royals all have in common?

Payrolls that are just right. Not too high, not too low. Just right.

"What on Earth is Abhi talking about," some of you mutter. I can hear you, even from the East Coast.

I want to talk about Major League payroll. Sure, not the most exciting thing on face, but trust me, by the end of this page I'll have you hooked.

The team that spent the most last season: the Dodgers, with a gut wrenching $272,789,040 spent in 2015. The teamy with the least? The miserly Marlins dished out $68,479,000 in 2015. Now, I don't know much about anything, but I believe neither of these teams won the 'ship last year. Oh wait... we did that. We won the thing.

So where did our Royals fall in terms of 2015 payroll? Exactly in the middle. 16th out of 30. 

This isn't any groundbreaking analysis. In fact, ever since Billy Beane and his A's brought Bill James' sabermetrics to the mainstream, team payroll and success have been correlated less and less as each year passes.

But can there be a sweet spot? Can you hit the payroll <i>just so</i> and see it soar over the left field wall?

I think the Royals have it figured out. Let's take a look at the AL last season. The biggest spenders behind the Dodgers were all AL teams, with the Yanks ($219,282,196) in 2nd, Red Sox ($187,407,202) in 3rd, and the Tigers ($173,813,750) in 4th. How did they compare with the Royals ($113,618,650) who were as middle-of-the-pack as you could get.

I think it's a multifaceted problem for those big spending teams. These teams all have high aspirations (and investor expectations) and therefore believe they are justified in throwing as much cash around as they did.
At the end of the day, though, spending tens/hundreds of millions of dollars on aging talent resulted in exactly the opposite of pennants for these teams; indeed, most of their stars spent significant time either injured or slumping, and even as their production went down, they still kept taking the field because teams have a tough time benching a $30 million dollar player, even if he's hitting like garbage (this one's for you, Red Sox).
Even worse, that meant they didn't really have the funds nor the player room to actually develop younger guys and give them time in the field. That means that teams with great farm systems like the Yankees end up with a rotation full of injury-prone, really expensive, and aging aces rounded out by a random below-league-average 3rd/4th slot pitcher like Nathan Eovaldi.

"There is something to be said about spending <i>some</i> money, though," I can hear you muttering again, and I'll give you credit where credit is due. Intuitively, a team that spends close to nothing can't possibly succeed, can they?

Well.........

The only team in the entire league that did well in the playoffs and was in the top half of the spending bracket in 2015 was the Cubbies.
In fact, the teams that make up the bottom half of the spending order are teams like the Royals, the Mets (21st, $101,409,244), the Pirates (25th, $88,278,500), and the Astros (29th!, $70,910,100).

But back to the Royals. I think we've figured out how to create a balanced payroll, while still being willing to put up higher paycheck numbers in recent years to support the growing market for baseball in KC, the growing fame of our hometown heroes, and expansion/growth-related expenses like paying our favorite players more to stick around (Gordo!).
And so we realize that it's not really how much teams spend, but how they spend.

Here's a handy dandy graphic I got from BI that really breaks down how teams are spending this season, and how much.

Now, there's a million things I could go on about regarding the graphic above (LOOK HOW MUCH MORE THE GIANTS ARE PAYING THEIR PITCHERS THAN THEIR POSITION PLAYERS), but I believe there is something to be said for inspecting the graphic by your lonesome and coming to your own conclusions. If you want, comment below! 

I hope this hasn't bored everyone to death. Just some stuff I thought was interesting.
Have a great day, friends. The Royals are about to start playing soon. And so I must leave you.
But with baseball back, I'll be putting up way more stuff and hopefully we can continue to nerd out about sports together.

Let me end with one of my favorite quotes: 

"Baseball is 90% mental, and the other half is physical." -- Yogi Berra.
