title: On Fairer Weather
---
By Aidan Garrett

After reading multiple online sources, I have found many different definitions of a "Fair-weather
Fan". Some say it is a person who switches from team to team, based on their athletic performance. 
Others say it is a fan that is just not as involved as others. Some devout fans would argue that I am not a 
true fan because I don’t have every statistic memorized, and that I don’t go to every single game with 
diamond-club seats. Even after watching the royals a few years now, I’m still not sure what I consider 
myself. What I do know is that the baseball team from my hometown has another shot to enter the 
World Series for the second year in a row. 

After watching the ‘yals duke it out last season and lead to #sweep the Orioles in the ALCS, I 
realized that being a Kansas sports fan, contrary to popular belief, has its moments. It’s not always 
feeling let down by the Chiefs, or watching The K-State football team get crushed by Oklahoma in a 55-0 
defeat. The Royals are the light at the end of a 30 year tunnel. I want to proudly wear my Moustakas 
shirt and Royals hat and show everyone that sees me that I care about and support a team that can 
perform at a World Series level.

Does that make me fair-weather? Maybe. Do I care about the criticisms that come with being 
fair-weather? Not really. When I’m in the stands and we rack up a few points on the board, no one can 
tell the difference between the cheers of a statistic maniac and someone who just enjoys the game. At 
the end of the day, I’m just happy to see my favorite baseball team excel in what they do best; play 
some good ‘ol fashioned baseball.

Let’s win this thing. #TakeTheCrown
