Hey friends. I wanted to put something out onto the interwebs that (hopefully) eloquently addresses the rather abrupt radio silence many readers have received from their beloved website. I don’t want to ignore it, and I think by explaining why, our relationship (between you, the reader, and I, the sports nerd who knows HTML) can continue to flourish. I really love this site and want to see it grow, and hopefully you want to come along for the ride. Together, we can take the sports world by storm. I haven’t given up on the vision that T.F.F can be a formidable presence in the social sports sphere. So let’s keep going.

Speaking of being a formidable presence, I have no qualms writing our first post back from radio silence about Steph the Chef Curry. Curry is a beast. There is no doubt about it. His Warriors were the best last season and it was no fluke, with Golden State putting up great numbers to find themselves 17-0. We all know they’re good. We all know Steph is good. But what’s so good about these Golden Boys?

Well, let’s look at their game against Phoenix a couple nights ago. Phoenix lit the Warriors up, with guard Eric Bledsoe shooting a great 70% from the field with 21 points to show for it. Bledsoe didn’t go off alone. Phoenix drained 116 points out of 92 shots, and any normal, human, mortal team would lose to that kind of offense. In fact, they didn’t just put up great shooting numbers. They also kicked ass in a bunch of other statistical areas. 21 assists show pretty good ball movement. 13 steals and 23 forced turnovers show a defense that definitely hustled out there. They outscored Golden State 26 to 17 on the fast break. They shot 70% on freebies. They even collected a decent 30 rebounds. Yet they never held the lead. What went wrong?

With a struggling organization like the Suns you can point to a lot. Maybe the fact that their starting big man Tyson Chandler only played 4 minutes, with 0 attempts from the field and only 2 rebounds to put on his stat line. If you look at the rest of the Suns bench, you’ll see a similar story, with way too many 0s to bode well. Only Warren worked out for the Suns off the bench, playing more minutes than any starter and also outscoring all the starters. So I guess we see a pattern of a power vacuum present on this team, with no one willing to take charge and really power this team through to the end. And because they never built up that momentum, the Warriors didn’t really have to worry about them. No, really. Like, they were so confident and comfortable that they pulled Curry out for the last quarter. He didn’t play 25% of this game.

Did I mention he scored 41 points in the first 75% of this game?

That’s right. Chef Curry is quite literally the answer to a team like the Suns’ woes. He is an unbeatable presence on the court. He leads. He follows. He passes. He scores. He does it all. So maybe, in cases like these, the easiest answer is actually the answer. Occam’s Razor and all that. Maybe all my beautiful analysis above doesn’t really matter because the question “Why did the Suns lose on Friday night?” can be answered with one quick, soft, yet menacing syllable.

Steph.

And that leads me to my last point of this already-too-long post. The reason I was totally comfortable with the site being quiet these last couple weeks was that I realized that I could just wait. Things like this could wait. Humans can prioritize for a reason. And you definitely don’t need me (or the writers) to drop everything and come run to the site to tell you stuff you can know a little later. Like with Steph. Steph is good. He will be good for a long time. That’s why I was okay waiting to tell you all about him. Because the real world struck. It struck especially hard these last couple weeks.

You may have heard about the protests and discussions taking place on campus over here in New Haven, along with schools like Mizzou, regarding the nature of racial discourse and the nature of discourse in and of itself. I’m not going to use this platform to talk about this stuff at length because 

1)	It wouldn’t really make sense here, and

2)	There are lots of people way smarter than me that are writing about this stuff, and I encourage you to look to the better-read experts about this stuff before you listen to opinions from people who don’t know what they’re talking about (a surprisingly large group, those who don’t know what they’re talking about; me included)

And so I get to the point, having beaten around the bush sufficiently. 

Sometimes real life is more important than sports. Sometimes it’s important to press pause on this wonderful leisure activity of ours and open our ears to listen to some of the brilliant and world-changing stuff happening around us. And sometimes that means writers won’t submit for a week because they’re taking in the joys of their favorite team winning the World Series. It means writers will be busy with school, or work, or other hobbies and passions. And sometimes it means that your favorite editor will get caught up in living, and studying, and taking tests. And maybe your beloved staff here at T.F.F will be spending time with family for a few days, and there won’t be content up. And I’m wholly and completely okay with all of that.

This site is run by people. It’s also read by people. And that’s the kind of magic that makes the world go ‘round.

Happy holidays, folks. And don’t worry. New content coming. See you soon.
