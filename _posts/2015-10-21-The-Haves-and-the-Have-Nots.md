title: More on Cueto - The Haves and the Have Nots
---
By Eric Cole

Daric’s article got me thinking so I had to expand.
[Editor's note: trust me folks, we should be glad he expanded - this article is fantastic! I didn't even add pictures. It's that good.]

It’s too early to tell how this season turns out for the Royals.  As I type this, the Royals are down 1 zip in Game 5 of the ALCS.  Volquez is pitching a great game but Estrada is pitching a notch or two better.  But there is a question that begs to be answered, even if the Royals win the World Series, and that is whether or not the Cueto trade was as effective as it was intended to be.

Many questions linger in my mind about the Cueto trade:

1) Did Cueto’s attitude inhibit his ability to pitch well?

2) Does Cueto want to be part of a winning team or does he just want to be part of a historic team?  (I ask this because back in August, while in Boston, Cueto professed his love for the Boston Red Sox by stating he wanted to go there because they are a “championship-caliber team.”  What exactly does he consider the Royals to be?)

3) Has Cueto been the reason for Yordano Ventura’s resurgence as a pitcher?  And, if so, is that because he has had a positive impact on him as a mentor … or because Ventura didn’t like the idea of Cueto coming in and taking over as the ace of the team.

4) Does Cueto know the millions of dollars he has cost himself in his implosion?  Does he even care …. because, invariably, some big dollar team will probably offer him tens of millions in a long term contract just in the hope he returns to his old self.

5) Is Cueto really as good as his statistics play him out to be?  And if so, why didn’t those statistics play out for the Royals?

I’m not a Cueto fan.  You’ve probably figured that out.  I don’t respect his attitude.  I don’t believe it fits with the team of guys we have with the Kansas City Royals.  For all the positivity and energy that Zobrist has brought to the team, Cueto has sapped an equal amount out of the team and it’s fans.   Even the Royal’s fans have a love / hate relationship with Cueto.  What Royals fan hasn’t trembled at the thought of Johnny Cueto pitching Game 7 of the ALCS if it happens.  (Yes, I know Ned would have him on a short leash but you can’t afford to give up even 2 runs to a team like Toronto.)

We all stood and yelled for Cueto in Game 5 of the ALDS.  We should have.  Regardless of his previous performances, he pitched an incredible game for the Royals.  That’s deserving of some applause.  He is one of the major reasons the Royals advanced to the ALCS and I will always give him credit for that moment in time.

But, then the real Johnny Beisbol returned in glorious fashion in Toronto in ALCS game 3 and was rocked out of the game causing our bullpen to go long.  He smiled as he left the field.  He remained cocky as ever.  He had put his teammates in a bad position and it was up to the rest of the team to attempt to get us out of the mess he created.  There didn’t seem to be any shame in that to him.  After the game he complained about “not getting any calls” (also known as the pitchers fallback excuse) and that the mound in the bullpen was different that the actual pitching mound.  These excuses were added to the an earlier weak excuse regarding Perez not setting up low enough for him and therefor causing his 9+ ERA over 5 games.  

He’s a professional ballplayer getting paid millions of dollars and he couldn’t go tell Salvador Perez what the issue was for him?  And he didn’t recognize this after 1 start?  Or even 2 starts?  If it’s not just an excuse, why let it go on for five starts?  It makes no sense.  But then, for someone who lives in a world of his making, maybe it making sense isn’t required.

Time will tell how it all plays out for the Royals … both short term and long term.  Will Brandon Finnegan and John Lamb be great pictures or footnotes in history?  Will the Royals journey end with a World Series Championship thereby negating all the Johnny Cueto talk?  (Who can’t argue that the Royals should be done now after winning 14 to 2 last night?  I mean, really, any team that scores 8 runs in game 3 should have been in a position to win game 3.)  

Maybe the Royals wouldn’t be where they are without Johnny Beisbol.  That argument could be made.  I understand that very clearly.  But my money is on the fact that there are so many great personalities on this team with great attitudes that they carried the Royals to where they are today and not the trade for Johnny Cueto.  I believe that Game 5 of the ALCS would still feature the Royals versus the Blue Jays.  That’s actually not true.  I believe there would have been no Game 5 of the ALCS because we’d now be waiting on Game 1 of the World Series.

I wasn’t sad the Royals didn’t even have a chance at making an offer for James Shields.  And I know I won’t be sad when the Royals small market team can’t make a run at Johnny “Beisbol” Cueto.  He doesn’t fit in with the team we’ve built and come to love.    The Royals have provided an immense amount of joy for all of us long time Royals fans over the past 3 years.  I’ll be in stands next season cheering the team on as they pound out runs on Boston’s newest overpriced signing:  Johnny Cueto.
