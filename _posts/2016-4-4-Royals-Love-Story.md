There's something about the Royals that really brings everyone together. We all saw it. Our city,
united as one, when our Kansas City Royals took home the Commissioner’s Trophy. 800,000 
Kansas Citians struggled through traffic and crammed themselves into the area around Union 
Station to see our boys in blue bring home the gold. School was cancelled all around KC 
because our baseball team won the World Series. Kansas City came together in celebration for 
our Royals. Our championship reign was long overdue and together we rule.

In the fall of 2014, the Royals faced the A’s in the AL Wild Card Game. I've been a Royals fan 
my whole life but they haven't exactly been good until 2014. So I had absolutely no idea how the 
MLB playoffs worked. So I tweeted at someone in the Blue Valley West band. I didn't really 
know the guy at all at the time but I knew he was obsessed with the Royals. His name is Ethan 
McChesney (@etmchesney27). I asked this scary upperclassman what would happen if the 
Royals win this Wild Card game. He explained and I thought to myself, “They have to go 
through 2 more series to get to the World Series? That's never going to happen.” If only I knew. 
Ethan is now one of my closest friends and the only one as insane for the Royals as I am. I've 
gone to countless games with him. I travelled to Minneapolis with him and his dad to see the 
Royals play and we have a trip to Chicago planned for May. Had the Royals not had their 2014 
playoff run, I might have never been such great friends with Ethan.

The Royals 2015 playoff run had all kinds of new fun. I shared this whole experience one again
with Ethan. The MLB playoffs are at the exact same time as the busiest part of the marching 
band season. I would probably have gone to every home playoff game had I not had marching 
band at the same time as many of them. But our rehearsals didn't stop Ethan and I from being 
completely in the know. I own an Apple Watch so every notification from the games came 
straight to me on the field. I got tweet notifications from the (former) Royals beat writer, Andy 
McCullough. I knew exactly what would be happening in each game. I had so much power. So, 
in the days before the 2015 ALDS Series, Ethan and I had come up with hand signals so that I 
could communicate with him from across the football field exactly what was happening in the 
game. I even had random band members come up to me and ask what was happening in the 
game. When the Royals play in the playoffs, everyone is your friend.

I woke up on this dull, spring break, Friday morning and I was missing Royals baseball. So I 
decided to write about them, just for the fun of it. So now I give you my cheesy ending 
paragraph.

Every Royals fan has stories from the playoff runs of 2014 & 2015. These stories are just two of 
my innumerable stories from the past 2 years. The Kansas City Royals gave me one of the best 
friendships that I have. Our World Champion Royals unite us as more than a city, when it comes 
to our boys in blues, we're all a family.
