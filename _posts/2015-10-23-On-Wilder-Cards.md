Recently, there has been debate about the format
of the Wild Card game. Some people believe it should 
be a best-of-three series rather then just one 
elimination game.  As of now there will be no 
changes. Proposals have been made but they all have 
been rejected. But is it time for change? Or should 
MLB stick with the current format that’s been working 
fine (for the teams that win, at least)? 

There could be benefits to the change to a best-
of-3 Wild Card series.  To start, both teams could 
have a better chance at winning and advancing to the 
ALDS/NLDS. A Wild Card series could create an 
opportunity to let the team who lost the theoretical 
game 1 redeem themselves and possibly end up winning 
the series. This format could be a better way of 
proving who is the better team. Rather than relying 
on one game to show the skill of the winning team, 
there could be two or even three games to demonstrate 
it. This would eliminate some possible major factors 
that show up in the current single Wild Card game. 

First, the starting pitchers. If the teams play 
only one game and everything is on the line then 
obviously they’re going to put out their best 
starting pitcher. With a three game series, the teams 
would have to put out their 2nd best or maybe 3rd best 
pitchers. This could eliminate the idea of the 
pitcher winning the game rather than the whole team. 
Second, bad days and good days. Every team has bad 
days of baseball and good days of baseball. What if 
the day of that one elimination game, it was bad day 
for the poor losing team or a good one for the 
champions? In a WC series, the loser of game 1 could 
have a chance to possibly redeem themselves.

Also, why have 1 breathtaking game (looking at 
you, 2014 AL Wild Card), when we could potentially 
see three incredible games before the ALDS or NLDS 
even starts? 

But if it ain’t broke, why fix it? The current 
Wild Card format has worked perfectly. Personally, I 
like it. I wouldn’t want it to change. Why? The 
intensity. One game where two teams, who have fought 
through 162 games to squeeze into the postseason, 
battle it out through 9+ innings to see whose season 
gets to continue. One game with the fate of the teams 
in its results. Why would anyone want that different? 
Plus, a 3 game series would just give that waiting 
number one seed team even more time to rest and just 
make the Wild Card champions even more tired when 
they face their next opponents in the ALDS or NLDS. 
That really isn’t fair in my opinion. 

Maybe eventually the format of the Wild Card 
postseason battle will be changed but for now I think 
its here to stay. Though, Commissioner Rob Manfred 
has been known to be open-minded commissioner so who 
really knows what will happen. I hope the one 
elimination game won’t be changed but I also think a 
three game series would add an interesting twist to 
the beginning of the MLB postseason. The postseason 
is a crazy time and you never know what you’ll see. 
So who could really be opposed to seeing a few more 
crazy games to start off October baseball every year?
