Hey all. Abhi posting.

I'm really excited to see this site grow and flourish, and because I'm so personally invested in the success of TFF, I'm constantly working to refine the quality of our service and to always make sure the experience here at TFF is better with every passing week.

That said, I'm very proud to announce a new feature on the site that will help readers navigate through different types of articles they might be interested in. Posts will now come with tags that will lead you to other articles tagged with the same keywords. In addition, readers can now navigate to the page containing all the current categories by using the "Posts by Sport" tab above.

I'm also working to make sure the homepage stays sleek and appealing, and I've decided that the 5 most recent posts will be showcased on the home page. All older posts will now be exclusively accessible via the "All Posts" tab above.

Again, with all these changes in formatting and design, any and all feedback is appreciated.

I'm hoping that by sticking to the fundamentals, we can continue to provide a unique and enjoyable sports content experience for all our readers.

Abhi
