What makes a season a failure?

It doesn't matter what sport you're watching, all teams, players, and coaches are seen as either failures or successes. Some may not be as clear as others, but some are so blatantly obvious that there is no way to argue that the season was a failure. For example, the Royals in years past have had failures of seasons, with losing records, and not getting anything out of the season. But records and postseason play don't have everything to do with the success of a season. Take a look.

Recruitment. Teams around the country and around the world recruit every year, looking for the best players with the most potential. Some of the time these players are great, some of the time they aren't (looking at you, Tim Tebow). These players help shape the successes and failures of a team in a season, but they don't define it. Recruitment can be great in a year, but the team could earn a losing record. The opposite can happen too, but neither of these make the season a failure. The recruitment process will happen again, only this time the team will have a base to build on instead of starting from scratch. I wouldn't consider a season that earns strong players a failure, even if the team does worse than expected.

Enjoyment. Imagine your team, a team that has never seen postseason play in your lifetime, finally makes it to a wild card game. And they win that game. And the next series. And the American League. And they advance all the way to the seventh game of the World Series, and they lose. Many people would see this as a failure, even though we won the American League championship, because we didn't win it all. But the amount of fun my family had, the people around me, and the team as a whole had was the most I've ever had. Calling that a failure would be like going to an amusement park, eating cotton candy and riding all the rides, and then leaving and realizing you forgot to ride one ride and starting to cry. It just doesn't happen. The season was a success in the way that it gave everyone an amazing time.

But what is a failure?

My thoughts go to occasions like "Deflategate". Now, I know that it hasn't been proven that they tampered with the footballs, but it's an example. The Patriots won the Super Bowl, but they almost lost Tom Brady for a fourth of the season, lost a million dollars, and they lost draft picks. They got rings, which is a success, but they lost all of that and respect from the football community as a whole. I think I speak for many when I say that was a failure, and any cheating like that which tarnishes a teams reputation is too.

Failure and success doesn't have to be based solely on the record of a team. Expanding the views of what you see as a success can change how you view a sport as a whole. So next time you're watching your favorite team, remember how can enjoy it even while losing.
