Johnny Cueto was the ace pitcher that the Royals desperately needed, and the pitcher fans desperately longed for.

After the departure of “Big Game” James Shields, the Royals pitching staff not only lacked depth, but also experience. This void was partially filled with the addition of Edinson Volquez, who has been nothing short of fantastic this year for a number two in the pitching rotation, posting a 3.55 ERA with over 200 innings pitched this season. But unforeseen problems with the young guns Duffy and Ventura, along with the injury to Jason Vargas left the pitching staff with more questions than answers. Johnny Cueto was supposed to be that answer, earning a 3.30 career ERA and a sub-3.00 ERA every year since 2011. Pre-trade-deadline Cueto was working his way through another great season, posting a 2.62 ERA with 130 innings pitched and 120 strikeouts. After the trade, however, was an entirely different beast: since the trade, Cueto has posted a 4.67 ERA and looked worse as the season progressed, putting together mediocre after mediocre start. The new question for an already over-taxed pitching staff was what to do with Cueto for the remainder of the postseason.

It is Tuesday morning as I write this. Last night, the Royals dropped their first game of the series, still up 2-1 against the Toronto Blue Jays. Cueto had a bad night – bad being a bit of an understatement. Cueto had a historically bad night: before last night, no postseason pitcher had ever given up 8 earned runs while only collecting 6 or fewer outs in the 112 years of baseball-reference.com data. So the question looms; what do the Royals do with Johnny Cueto for the rest of the season? Cueto is the guy they traded two potential middle rotation lefties for in John Lamb and Cody Reed, and a third lefty in Brandon Finnegan, who could easily find a place right now on a 25-man roster. Do they continue to play him? Even through this terrible second half, he has shown glimpses of the superstar the Royals thought they were acquiring, like in the deciding game 5 against the powerful and explosive Astros. Johnny Baseball dealt a phenomenal 8 innings of 2 hit, 2 run baseball, which many fans took as a good sign for games to come. Johnny Cueto was supposed to be the symbol of a Royals squad that had bought into the idea of winning, and winning often, and a tribute to all the hard years fans went through , but the Royals are now past the time for hoping for a player’s resurgence; they need results, and Ned Yost needs to finally answer the question that the City is asking. What will he do with Johnny Cueto?
