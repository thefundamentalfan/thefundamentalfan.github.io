title: Jays Fly, But Royals Learn
---

By Spencer Norkey

The Blue Jays finally got their bats swinging in last night’s game. Troy Tulowitzki, Josh Donaldson, and Ryan Goins each went for deep in the 11-8 Jays victory.

Going into the game, the Blue Jays had a win or die mindset, believing that falling to  3 games behind in the seven game series would be an impossible mountain to climb, and so they came out firing. The Royals stayed close to them through the first and second inning, striking first, but then letting in 3, and scoring again, but finally, in the third inning, a hole was blown through. Johnny Cueto, who people thought would be KC’s new ace, let in 5 runs, letting in a grand total of 8 runs through 3 innings before being taken out. This set a new record, but not one the Royals were hoping to set [Editor’s note: see Daric’s piece for an explanation of this!]. Throughout the rest of the game, the Royals outscored the Jays 6-3, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the significant deficit that Cueto had manufactured. A ninth inning rally brought the Royals hope, with Hendriks letting two in and another runner in scoring position, and Osuna assisting a 2 run homer by Morales, but he quickly shut them out after that, leaving the Royals three runs short of a chance. This game goes further to show that, even in the face of an inevitable loss, the Royals never stop playing. “We don’t give up until the game is over. If we have another at-bat, we feel we are going to win. The score doesn’t matter. It doesn’t change our mindset,” said Alex Gordon, Royals OF, according to MLB.com. “That’s how we play.”
