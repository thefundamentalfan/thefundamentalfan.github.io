I was born into a family with deep ties to Kansas City, I had no chance from the beginning. I was 
too young to defend myself from the barrage that is sports pain. My mother, a Kansas City native, 
was born to parents with Chiefs season tickets. She had no chance either. She was nurtured 
from birth in the culture of Chiefs football. She was lucky enough to watch the greatness of 
Derrick Thomas and unlucky enough to witness the failure of Lin Elliott. To this day it is hard for 
her to talk about the Chiefs being successful without getting choked up. She juxtaposed that 
pain with the joy of a Kansas Basketball National Championship in 1988, her junior year. She 
had little interest in baseball. She remembers the 1985 championship and riding around with her 
friends after the game screaming out the car because that's what everyone did.

My father on the other hand was born in Salina, Kansas and moved to Manhattan at the age of 
12. In between he lived everywhere western Kansas has to offer, so not much. He moved to 
Kansas City in the late 80's after meeting my mother. He always had an underlying love for 
sports, as his teenage home was just blocks from the Kansas State football stadium. He had never 
endured sports pain, however, and not until the Chiefs teams of the late 90's and early 2000's did he begin to 
feel my mother's' pain. He had no connection to baseball, the interest had just never been there. 
They say you are, at least to some extent, a version of your parents, and that is certainly true in 
my case. My interest in football came from an obvious place but baseball was much more 
subtle. In the summer after eighth grade I became suddenly and instantly interested in baseball. 
For the life of me, I can not remember a singular moment that something changed in me, and I wish I 
could. In the last four years my fondness and passion for the Royals has grown, coinciding with 
their return from baseball purgatory. I am lucky enough to have parents that support my 
obsession. They can't help it, they understand through experience how I feel. 

I am incredibly excited to join Abhi in sharing my opinions with all of you from time to time...
