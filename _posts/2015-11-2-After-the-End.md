Baseball is unique, it is exceptional, and it is gratifying. It is the best and worst that life has to 
offer. It can instantly create unadulterated joy while also crushing the hearts of those who pour 
into it. On November 1st, 2015 the Royals took those years of pain and made it all worthwhile. 
As I have noted before I'm lucky, I didn't start watching baseball until 2010, a far shorter time 
than many of those who live in Kansas City. For the longest time it wasn't a healthy relationship 
between the Royals and all of us, it was one sided, we were ignored, it was like they didn't care. 
I certainly don't envy the Royals fans who persevered through 30 years of frustration but respect 
wouldn't even begin to describe what I do feel. They had no reason to stick with this team but 
they did, I am happy for them today. I am happy for the people of Kansas City, a midwest city 
that never receives the love it deserves, full of people who care so deeply about their baseball 
team. I am happy for Lorenzo Cain, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Alex Gordon, Danny Duffy, 
Wade Davis, and Edinson Volquez. All of them and countless others in this organization 
deserve this success, they were patient when many in Kansas City were not. The narrative with 
the Royals was that Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas were going to become super stars and 
lead this team to a championship. It took longer than expected but in a sport where certainties 
are few and far between it is fulfilling to see this narrative actually become reality. I am happy for 
Ned Yost, once maligned for lackluster managing and a fundamental misunderstanding of what 
it took to win a championship now has a statue waiting to be built of him at Kauffman Stadium. I 
am happy for Dayton Moore, he inherited nothing and built a winner, he did his job. A day after a 
World Series Championship I am struggling to fully understand what has actually happened. 
Moments I never thought I would see in person happened last night. Queen songs playing in 
Power and Light, hugging random strangers on the sidewalks of downtown Kansas City, and 
Zac jumping into fountains on the Plaza. 

I am happy for myself. Sports are such a defining part of my life, they are what I am thinking 
about most of the time. People ask me why I care so much about the Royals and it is hard for 
me to explain because how do you qualify what a sport means to you? It will likely take years for 
me to fully understand and put into words what last night meant to me. It is the culmination of 
hours of watching games on summer nights and of driving to The K to witness baseball in the 
heaven that is Kauffman Stadium. It is the pinnacle of why I am a sports fan. Last night the 
Royals captivated me just like they have so many nights in the past except this time it was a 
little bit different. I will never forget the 2015 Royals, they will live in my memory forever, it would 
be impossible to forget them even if I tried. Flags will fly forever.

A dream became a reality last night, so never stop believing.

Sports mirror life.
