The pressure is on in Kansas City.

From every direction, a familiar question is railing against the Royals front office, and no doubt affecting player morale as well: should the boys in blue begin rebuilding, or give it one last shot?

As early as March, sites like <a href="https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2017/5/23/15674678/royals-salvador-perez-danny-duffy-eric-hosmer-rebuild">beyondtheboxscore.com</a> have been prognosticating the window closing for the Royals, with some even characterizing it as <a href="https://www.royalsreview.com/2017/5/24/15655874/a-royals-rebuild-is-inevitable">"inevitable"</a>.

I haven't made up my mind quite yet. I'm a solid "hold" on the Roys, because on the one hand from the perspective of a fan, they're absolutely tearing it up ever since that prophetic speech by Yost that proclaimed they had to "find a way to get on a nice run where you win 15 out of 22" and 22 games and 15 wins later, the Royals were up to 30-21 from a meager 15-14 at the start of the season. But on the other, they seem to be stuck at around .500, as they're up to 49-47 after the 7-2 win over the White Sox last night, even though the seemingly mediocre record is good enough for 2nd in the AL central.

Considering they're only 1.5 games behind the division-leading Indians, this summer could decide what kind of year this ends up being for the Royals. We're 1 game back from the Yanks in the AL Wild Card race, and we're playing pretty well right now. Moustakas and Hosmer have been hitting well, and our starting pitching has been showing up. Duffy is back, and the whole team seems to be clicking, running on all cylinders this July as they matched a franchise record for homers in a game this Saturday. 

All in all, it's proving to be an entertaining and exciting season, even as our playoff hopes sit in the uncomfortable shade of uncertainty.

Here's to a run akin to the one started 3 years ago, to this day, when the Royals were down 48-50 and Moose homered twice like he did last night, and the Royals went on to win 24 of the next 30 games, putting them in 1st and helping to secure a key playoff run.

We can certainly dream. It's only July, after all.
