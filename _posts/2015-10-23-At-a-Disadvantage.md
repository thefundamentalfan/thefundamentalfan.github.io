Baseball is the ultimate underdog sport yet for the longest time it hasn't been. Baseball has long 
been criticized for it's lack of parity, casual fans will bark that the "Yankees and the Cardinals 
are the only ones who ever win!" To an extent they are correct, those two teams have 
participated in eleven of the last twenty World Series. Teams that have a long history of success 
tend to continue that success no matter the time period or state of the game. This theory lends 
itself to disapproval from those who are interested in baseball and it pushes them away from the 
game, something baseball can hardly afford to have happen. In a time when the growth of the 
game is at an all time high in revenues and attendance baseball is still losing the interest of 
children and young people. The commissioner of baseball, Rob Manfred, has recently stated the 
disastrous effects of potentially losing an entire generation of young fans. Parity in the game 
draws people in, let's be honest it is more compelling to see the Mets, Cubs [Editor's note: Too soon!] or Royals in a 
World Series than the Yankees, Cardinals, or Phillies.

Occasionally parity is particularly hard to come by in baseball due to the nature of the game. 
Unlike the salary cap style of the NFL or NBA, Major League Baseball is run on a system of 
unequal distribution. A very small portion of each teams budget comes from revenue sharing in 
contrast to the NFL where almost the entirety of a team's money is shared throughout the 
league. In MLB the owner of each team provides a larger part of the funding for the team, 
couple this with gigantic local television deals and teams that are continuously successful are 
given constant streams of money and those that aren't are not so fortunate. This creates a 
circumstance where teams like the Dodgers or Yankees can have two hundred to even three 
hundred million dollar payrolls. In turn this allows for them to steamroll teams in free agency and 
international markets. The Miami Marlins, Tampa Bay Rays, and Arizona Diamondbacks had 
the three lowest payrolls in baseball this year with player contracts totaling sixty two, seventy 
three, and seventy six million dollars respectively. It is relatively impossible and unrealistic for 
these teams and thirteen of the other bottom fifteen whose payrolls fall below one hundred and 
twenty million to sign high priced free agents and compete in Cuban and Dominican markets. 
The solution to this dilemma is small market and middle market teams who find ways to make 
calculated risks and corner the markets on types of players who are cheaper or not valued as 
highly by large market organizations. Examples of this in recent memory is the Pittsburg Pirates 
of the last few years, the Oakland A's teams of the early 2000's or even the Royals teams of 
2014 and 2015. All of these teams have developed new strategies for how to maximize the 
value of their revenue instead of just throwing it at older sluggers each time they get a chance.

The idea of an underdog is that they don't just have an inherent or created disadvantage placed 
against they but they feel that disadvantage. It not only weighs on a team to lose, it weighs on a 
city as well. In Kansas City the weight of not winning for multiple decades sometimes 
sometimes felt like it could never be lifted but instead the Royals have, in an instant, created a 
generation of fans that will be forever loyal to them because they have seen them win. Parity in 
baseball, when it is cultivated, generates renewed interest from old fans and new interest from 
younger fans. We have entered an era where small market cities and organizations have nearly 
just as strong a chance to win as everyone else as long as they are innovative. The Royals 
have been innovative, they have created their own way to win, and I'll be damned if that hasn't 
been great for all of us.
