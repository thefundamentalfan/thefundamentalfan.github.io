Hey friends. Long time no see. Just wanted to stick my head out and tell you all happy holidays. I sincerely hope this New Year brings good tides for everyone.

Instead of another boring and overused “Top 10 Moments in Sports” recap for the year, I decided to write a quick post that includes a little bit about what I hope this next year in sports brings, a little bit about the Chiefs, and as per my friend and TFF colleague Aidan’s request, a little bit about women’s curling.

Let’s start with women’s curling. 

So in my research to fulfill Aidan’s request, I first had to look up curling. Because yeah, I kind of know what it is, but I just wanted to be sure. Just to clarify, curling is a lot like giant shuffleboard on ice. Players slide polished granite stones down the ice towards the target. The target is familiar; the closer you get to the center, the more points your team gets. This game sounds relatively easy. It is not. It’s on ice. The target is huge, and the center is small. The stones are really, really heavy.

Now onto the Women’s bit. I learned that there is a Women’s Curling Championship occurring every year, unsurprisingly. In 2015, the host city was Sapporo, Japan. It took place in March. It was won by Switzerland, which is a big deal because Canada is the top ranked team in the world and Switzerland is 8th. They only beat our neighbors to the north by 1 match, while actually shooting at a lower percentage than the presumably salty runners-up. If I’ve piqued your interest, the 2016 Ford World Women’s Curling Championship is being held from March 19-27 in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Because curling. And it is sponsored by Ford because we live in a capitalist nightmare world.

Let’s go to my hopes and dreams, in which I’m sure all of you are very interested.

I hope this next year brings a delightful finish to a great KC postseason run. What does that look like? I mean, I’m not necessarily asking for or expecting a Chiefs Super Bowl (it would be swell, though); I think I’m just looking for a happy ending. If the Chiefs do well and do us proud, our city will get the conclusion that 2015 in KC deserves. How likely is it? The Chiefs are 10-5, with those 5 losses coming in their first 6 games, and they’ve won 9 in a row. And yeah, this is football; teams get hot and scrape a couple wins together. But as Barnwell’s analysis proves over at ESPN, these wins aren’t scraped together. The big Chiefs have won by an average of 16 points in every game but 2, perhaps insinuating that this is more than a hot streak. Is yet another KC team truly undervalued and underrated, and preparing to show their true force in a red hot postseason rally? Fingers crossed.

In broader terms, I also hope that this next year we can all remember why we love sports in the first place. The camaraderie, the friendship, the purest excitement and the tears of disappointment - these are all important things that we connect to our favorite games and pastimes. Our sports, no matter which we choose to love (or which capture our heart against our wills), they enrich our lives and make us better humans. So here’s to another year of the magic. Good wishes, and I’ll see you all on the other side.
