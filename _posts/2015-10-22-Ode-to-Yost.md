title: Ode to Yost
---
By Zac Cole

Edgar Frederick “Ned” Yost was born on August
19, 1954 in Eureka, California. He attended and 
played baseball at Dublin High School and then the 
Chabot Junior College as a catcher. In 1974, he was 
drafted by the New York Mets as the 7th overall pick. 
He made his MLB debut on April 12, 1980 for the 
Milwaukee Brewers (He went 0 for 1. But A+ for 
effort, Ned).

Yost played for the Milwaukee Brewers for 4 
years, Texas Rangers for 1 year and the Montreal 
Expos for his final year in 1985. He was no 
extraordinary player back then if we’re being honest 
here. The most games he played in a season was 80 
(less than half the season) and he never had more 
than 242 at bats in a single season. He only had 128 
career hits, 16 homeruns and 64 RBIs (Big Ken Morales 
had 106 RBIs this past season). His career batting 
average was a mere .212 with an OPS of just .566. He 
did, though, have a .982 fielding percentage with the 
league average being .987. Yost played his last game 
on October 6, 1985.

On October 29, 2003, Ned Yost became the manager 
of the Milwaukee Brewers. Yost was initially praised 
for his work as manager in Milwaukee. The Brewers 
finished .500 or above 3 of the 6 years Yost served 
as manager. Milwaukee started to turn on him late in 
the 2007 season. The Brewers has an 8 ½ game division 
lead on the Cubs but gave it up by the middle of the 
season. They ended up 2 games behind Chicago. Yost 
would still return for the 2008 season but was fired 
that year on September 15 with just 12 games left in 
the season.

On May 13, 2010, Ned Yost was named manager of 
the Kansas City Royals. And in 2013 under his 
management, the Royals finished 86-76 (.531), the 
first winning record for the Royals since 2003. And a 
year later, as we all know, Ned Yost and the Royals ended Kansas City’s 29-year postseason drought. On 
September 26, 2014, the Royals clinched a spot in the 
2014 postseason. They won the Wild Card game in a 
breathtaking 12 innings, they swept the ALDS and 
ALCS, and went all the way to Game 7 of the World 
Series. And now for the second year in a row the 
Royals are in the postseason. And one win away from 
another World Series.

Ned Yost is now the longest tenured manager in 
Kansas City Royals history. He is also the winningest 
manager is franchise history (he claimed this title 
after a win against the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Appropriate, huh?). 

So despite his mediocre times as a player, his 
work as a manager is phenomenal. Kansas City loves 
Ned Yost. He’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he’s serious 
and best of all, the Royals do good baseball things 
with him. So I hope Ned is going to stick around. 
He’s made a huge impact on Kansas City. He lifted the 
Royals from being a team that couldn’t get above a 
.500 record to a championship team that is in the 
postseason 2 years in a row. I don’t think his legacy 
and work in Kansas City will ever be forgotten.

You just got Yosted.
