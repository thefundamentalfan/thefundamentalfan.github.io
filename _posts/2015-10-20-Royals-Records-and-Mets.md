I'm determined not to let this become a Royals only site, so bear with me at the beginning of this post. I'll try to keep it short.

So the Royals won tonight. After Cueto setting that awful franchise record last night. All in all, 14-2 was plenty revenge. Yep, you read that right. 14-2. Here's a picture of the sad Jays dugout if you don't believe me.

Speaking of postseason records, Kyle Schwarber knocked the seams out of his 5th postseason homerun. Even though he's only played in 8 postseason games. And now he's hit more postseason homeruns than any Cubbie ever. Seriously. And even though guys like Schwarber and Rizzo are doing great for the Cubs, the team they're playing has been doing better.

It's about time I owned up to the fact that I was dead wrong about the Postseason Mets.

I was just telling a friend before the division series started that the Mets lineup couldn't hold up to the explosive Cubs. At the time of writing, the Mets are up 2 games in the series and about to win the third and I could not possibly look more foolish for denouncing the power of the Mets. I thought what I had was solid, unbiased reasoning: I assumed the Mets’ explosive offense was completely dependent upon the skills of guys like Cespedes, Wright, and Duda, and I thought they would crumble against good pitching. Trouble is, as I was quickly reminded, that guys like Daniel Murphy will always show up to save the day. Even old man Granderson can step up – offensively and defensively – when times get tough, going on to show that what I thought was the Mets’ biggest weakness for the postseason was actually their biggest strength: they don’t lack depth, they exude depth. Everything about the way their lineup is structured makes certain that some bats are always hot and some players are out there making plays. What’s incredibly annoying – not to Mets fans, of course – is that even their bullpen is deep! DeGrom, even when struggling, puts up ace numbers, along with starters Matz and Harvey making sure the bullpen never has a tough job. Even when the bullpen must come in, it’s Syndergaard, a really, really good pitcher, and I don’t need to say anything about Familia’s perfect execution at the end of ball games.

I guess the lesson to be learned is, don’t underestimate these Mets. Yeah, sure, they won a tough NL East but I somehow found a reason to doubt them. So don’t do what I did, friends. These Mets may make it all the way this year, and I can tell you firsthand from walking through Queens earlier today that no one is more excited about the prospect of a championship in Queens than those crazy Mets fans.

Stay crazy, guys.
