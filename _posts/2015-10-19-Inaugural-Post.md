Hey all. Abhi posting. The site is officially up, and we'll get down to business very soon. Welcome to The Fundamental Fan, a sports opinion and analysis site. Our mission statement: No noise. No nonsense. Just the fundamentals.

Features will continue to be added to the site, and I'm excited to share this experience with you all. Hopefully we'll have some posts up soon written by people that aren't me! As always, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @abhisharma213 or via email/text. We also have a site email address. Feel free to shoot an email to thefundamentalfan@gmail.com.

See you all very soon,

Abhi
